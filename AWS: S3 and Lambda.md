# AWS: S3 and Lambda

## Review, Research, and Discussion

   1. Describe “The Cloud”
    - The cloud is made up of servers in data centers all over the world. Moving to the cloud can save companies money and add convenience for users.
   2. What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?
    - A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. 
   3. What is auto-scaling?
    - monitors your applications and automatically adjusts capacity to maintain steady, predictable performance at the lowest possible cost.
   4. What is bandwidth?
    - Bandwidth is often mistaken for internet speed when it's actually the volume of information that can be sent over a connection in a measured amount of time – calculated in megabits per second (Mbps).
   5. How do cloud providers compute service costs?
    - They start by calculating costs for network hardware, network infrastructure maintenance, and labor. These expenses are added together and then divided by the number of rack units a business will need for its IaaS cloud.

## Vocab 
   1. Server Instances
    - A server instance is a collection of SQL Server databases which are run by a solitary SQL Server service or instance.
   2. Containers
    - "A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another."
   3. Cloud Services
    - Cloud services are infrastructure, platforms, or software that are hosted by third-party providers and made available to users through the internet. 
   4. Cloud Architecture
    - Cloud Architecture refers to the various components in terms of databases, software capabilities, applications, etc. engineered to leverage the power of cloud resources to solve business problems. Cloud architecture defines the components as well as the relationships between them.
   5. AWS
    - Amazon Web Services  
   6. EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku
    - Beanstalk is an AWS service that allows application deployment. Heroku is a standalone, with higher prices, but simpler design.
