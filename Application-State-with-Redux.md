# Application State with Redux  

## Review, Research, and Discussion  

1. What are the advantages of storing tokens in “Cookies” vs “Local Storage”
    - Both localStorage and cookies are vulnerable to XSS attacks but it's harder for the attacker to do the attack when you're using httpOnly cookies.
2. Explain 3rd party cookies.
    - Third-party cookies are cookies that are set by a website other than the one you are currently on.
3. How do pixel tags work?  
    - You add the tracking pixel using a code in your site's HTML code or email, which contains an external link to the pixel server. When someone visits your website, the HTML code is processed by their browser, which follows the link and opens the hidden graphic.
