# OSS

## What does it mean to me?

- OSS or open source software, is software that anyone is able to upload their code to, and are able to see immediate results. In some cases you are able to upload and update certain designs of code on a website, and get constructive feedback from your peers. While it might not all be positive, it is good to get the feedback so that you learn from the experience, and grow as developer for the future. Making sure that you learn from whatever it is that you built, and learning new ways to improve is two of the top qualities of a professional developer. At least to me it is.
