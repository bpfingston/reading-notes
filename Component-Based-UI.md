# Component Based UI  

## Review, Research, and Discussion  

   1. Name 5 Javascript UI Frameworks (other than React)  
        a. Angular  
        b. Vue.js  
        c. Meteor  
        d. Mithril  
        e. Node.js  
   2. Whatâ€™s the difference between a framework and a library?  
        a. Library: When you use a library, you are in charge of the flow of the application. You are choosing when and where to call the library.  
        b. Framework: When you use a framework, the framework is in charge of the flow. It provides some places for you to plug in your code, but it calls the code you plugged in as needed.  
        c. Basically it comes down to inversion of control, or which way the flow of control is going, either from the framework to you, or from you to the library.
