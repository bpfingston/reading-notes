# Data Modeling

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development
    - Preventing bugs
    - Better Program Design 
    - ensure the success of code
2.  In what case would you need to use `beforeEach() `or `afterEach()` in a test suite?
    - whenever there are instances of multiple tests being performed.
3.  What is one downside of Test Driven Development
    - slows down the progress, as you increase workload.
4.  What’s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?
    - ES6 creates objects by adding function to their prototypes, Constructors create objects along with inheritance properties
5.  Why REST?
    - it defines a standard architecture for creating APIs.

## Vocab

1.  `functional programming` - is the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects.  
2.  `object-oriented programming (OOP)` - is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic.  
3.  `class` - is an extensible program-code-template for creating objects, providing initial values for state and implementations of behavior.  
4.  `super` - used to call the constructor of its parent class to access the parent's properties and methods.  
5.  `this` -the term used when an object refers to it’s own properties and behaviors
6.  `Test Driven Development (TDD)` - A software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed, tracks software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases.
7.  `Jest` - a JavaScript testing framework with a focus on simplicity and support for large web applications.
8.  `Continuous Integration (CI)` - the practice of frequently integrating one's new or changed code with the existing code repository —should occur frequently enough that no intervening window remains between commit and build, and such that no errors can arise without developers noticing them and correcting them immediately.
9.  `REST` - Represental State Transfer is an improved way to handle function parameter, allowing us to more easily handle various input as parameters in a function.
10. `Data Model` - a type of modeling for visual representation of how information communicates and connects between data points and structures
