## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

    1. What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?
        -  6 reasons
            1. Greater efficiency - two people focusing on the same code base find mistakes faster, research answers faster, and it also enhances technical skills, team communication, and even enjoyability of coding in the workplace.  
            2. Engaged collaboration - keeps people more engaged and focused on the task at hand. Stops people from checking social media or procrastinating if someone is counting on your help. It builds confidence to ask for help when needed.  
            3.  Learning from fellow students - everyone has a different approach to problem solving, and working with others can lead people to learning a different way to solve problems they would have never thought of. Also devs have different skill sets that can be taught to others that might be less knowledgable in certain areas than others.  
            4.  Social skills - forces people to develop social skills, as communication is key in pair programming. They are also able to develop their interpersonal skills and how to work well with others.  
            5.  Job interview readiness - prospective employers might have you participate in pair programming with an employee at the company to get a feel as whether you might fit in with the environment, your communication skills, as well as your techinical skills capacity(or ability to learn different skills.)
            6.  Work environment readiness - prospective employers expect to gain people who need to be taught how to actually deliver a product, but CF grads will already know how to do this with pair programming.
    2. In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?
        -  Engaged Collaboration, as it helps people find answers to problems they wouldn't find by themselves normally. It also allows you to stop the procrastination that might be tempting you with the various forms of social media and the like. 
    3. How does pair programming work?
        -  It requires 2 or more individuals to work together, with one person, the driver, writing all the code on their laptop(desktop) that is told to them by another individual, the navigator. While the navigator is telling the driver the steps to take and what code to put down, that doesn't stop the driver from commenting about ideas that come to their head or potential problems that might arise within the code. At some point, the two individuals will switch jobs, and continue where they left off. Both individuals are expected to polite, respectful, and listening to what the other has to say. This doesn't mean you don't disagree with the other, but that you at least listen, and try to understand where the other is coming from.
