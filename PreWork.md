#Pre-Work

## Reading and Reference Materials:  
   ##### Solving Problems #####  
        1. Read the problem completely twice.  
        2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.  
        3. Optimize the manual steps.  
        4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.  
        5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.  
        6. Optimize the real code.  
   ##### Act like you make $1000/hr #####
        1. Place a value on your own time
        2. The respect you have for yourself, typically affects how people in turn will respect you.
        3. take time to unwind so that you can focus on what is important.
        4. know when to say yes and no.
   ##### How to think like a programmer #####
        1. Understand - explain in plain english what a problem is asking of you, because only when you can truly understand the problem, can you actually begin to code it.
        2. Plan - don't start with coding right away, analyze the multiple solutions, and decide what is best.
        3. Divide - Break the bigger problems into smaller problems, so that you can better understand and work the problem.
        4. Stuck? - Breath. take time to debug your working solution, research other solutions, and reassess what is the optimal solution.
   ##### The Five Whys #####
        1. Asking why, until you get to the root problem, and figure out why something isn't working.
