# AWS: API, Dynamo and Lambda

## Review, Research, and Discussion

   1. What are serverless functions?
    - A serverless function is a programmatic function written by a software developer for a single purpose. It's then hosted and maintained on infrastructure by cloud computing companies.
   2. If you were to create a system that emulated Lambda functions, how would you do it?
    - umm stuff, and things?
   3. Describe how a CDN works
    - A CDN is a network of servers that distributes content from an “origin” server throughout the world by caching content close to where each end user is accessing the internet via a web-enabled device. The content they request is first stored on the origin server and is then replicated and stored elsewhere as needed.
