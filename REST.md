# REST

## How I explained REST to my brother

    1.  Who is Roy Fielding?  
        -  He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does.  

    2.  Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we    need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?  
        -  because the techniques used later by developers didnt have the requirements to talk to all the machines in the world.  

    3.  What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?  
        -  They created REST which provides a definiton of a resource to which the computers talk to. It provides understanding to nouns, and verbs, which goes into a theory called "polymorphism."  
    4.  What does a GET do?  
        -  retrieving information from different areas.  
    5. What does a POST do?  
        -  one system needs to add something to another system.  
    6. What does PUT do?  
        -  a system wants to replace something in another system.  
    7. What does PATCH do?  
        - to do a partial update.
