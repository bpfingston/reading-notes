# AWS: Cloud Servers

## Review, Research, and Discussion

   1. Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle
        - A user gives a client a URL
        - the client builds a request for information to be generated by a server.
        - The server recieves a request and builds a response that contains the requested information.
        - The response is sent back to the client in the requested format, to be rendered to the user.
   2. Explain what a “server” is, as it relates to the WRRC
        - When the server receives a request, it uses the information included in the request to build a response that contains the requested information
   3. What does it mean to “deploy” an application?
        - the process of installing, configuring, and enabling a specific application or set of applications, usually through an application manager (app manager) or software management system, to a specific URL on a server.
